print("Total 51 balls available in bucket ")
a=51
c=range(1,100)
for i in c:
    b=int(input("player no.1 Enter your number: "))
    a-=b
    print("remaining ball: ",a)
    if a==0:
        print("Player no. 1 loose the game.")
        break

    c=int(input("Player no. 2 enter your number: "))
    a-=c
    print("remaining ball ",a)
    if a==0:
        print("Player no.2 loose the game.")
        break
